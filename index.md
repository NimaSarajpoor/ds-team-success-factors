## Today's slides

[ericmjl.github.io/ds-team-success-factors](https://ericmjl.github.io/ds-team-success-factors/)

---

## 🎯 Today's Focus

---

Q1: What does it take for a data science team to successfully deliver long-lasting impact through data products?

---

Q2: How do we do that in a biotech research setting?

---

## 🗝️ Four Key Ideas

1. A framework for bounding work
2. Clarity on high-value use cases
3. Technical and interpersonal skillsets
4. Necessary surrounding context

---

## 💭 Philosophy

- Aim for lasting solutions beyond project duration.
- Focus on building solutions that serve long-term.

---

## 📚 Idea 1: Framework @ Moderna DSAI

- 3 rows: mRNA, Proteins, LNPs
- 3 columns: AI library design, computer vision, probabilistic models + custom algorithms

---

## ❌ What we don't do

- Bioinformatics
- Computational chemistry
- Protein structure modelling

Clarity is key for collaboration.

---

## ❓ What does your team do and not do?

- Clear lines of division
- Dynamic range when necessary

---

## 🔍 Idea 2: Clarity on High-Value Use Cases

- Highest value takes priority.
- Two definitions of value:
  - Trade between a data scientist's time and another team's time.
  - New capabilities unlocked and their expected value.

---

## 🌟 Examples

- Automated chromatography analysis
- Predictive models for AI library design
- Quantitative image analysis

---

## 🧵 Threads

- Save time
- Unlock new capabilities

---

## 🛠️ Idea 3: Technical and Interpersonal Skillsets

- [Hiring and Interviewing Data Scientists](https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/people-skills/hiring/#scientific-knowledge)
  - People skills
  - Communication skills
  - Scientific domain knowledge
  - Software development skills
  - Modeling skills

---

## 🧠 Modeling Skills

Going beyond off-the-shelf models:

- Mechanistic
- Probabilistic
- Deep learning

---

## 💻 Software Development Skills

- Refactoring
- Documentation
- Testing
- Versioning

> Projects live long when they are built like well-designed software.

---

## 🔬 Scientific Domain Knowledge

- Language, vocabulary, vernacular
- Understanding of the scientific process

> A nuanced understanding of our colleagues' work builds trust and credibility!

---

## 🗣️ Communication Skills

- Clear, concise, and effective
- Upwards, downwards, and sideways

---

## 👥 People Skills

- Opinionated and empathetic
- Bridge builder
- Drives towards clarity
- Resilient under pressure

---

## 🌐 Idea 4: Necessary Surrounding Context

- Integration into research processes.
- Robust technology stack for longevity.

---

## 📖 Story 1: ML for Protein Engineering

---

## 🐁 Story 2: Mouse Motion Analysis

---

## 💻 Story 3: Computational Design Workflow

---

## 🚀 Moderna DSAI Deliverables

- Python packages
- Cloud-skinned CLI tools
- AI library designs

> Product-orientation gives us scale beyond service-orientation.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure

- Standardized project scaffold
- Single deployment endpoint

---

## 🧐 Radical Clarity

1. What we do and don't do
2. High-value use cases
3. Technical and interpersonal skillsets
4. Necessary surrounding context
